# Dave Madden's "7 GUIs" Takehome Assignment

Assignment:<br>
Create all [7 GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks) using React+Typescript

## The GUIs

### The Counter

### The Temperature Converter

This works, but if I have the time I'll come back and refactor to using one hook and one changeHandler.

### The Flight Booker

### The Timer!

I got this working, but I would like to revisit this with a custom hook (more flexible) like in [this blog post](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/)

### CRUD

### Circle Drawer
